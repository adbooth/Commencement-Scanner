The system was developed for a computer engineering senior capstone class for the University at Buffalo. Nine students worked on the system in two separate groups. Specifically a team which developed the web application and a team to develop the hardware and software. The system went through two major iterations before the final system was delivered.

The system was built to solve the following problems:
 - The pronunciation of students’ names is frequently done poorly by the readers during commencement. This problem is solved by pre-recording the names with the students’ pronunciation preference in mind
 - It can be difficult to keep track of the order of the graduating students for reference for the photographer. It is currently done by taking a student’s name card and putting it on a fishline as the students come up.
